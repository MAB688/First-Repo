My program asks for a user's name and favorite color. It then prints a statement saying the given name's favorite color.

*What it does*  
My theoritical project is a piece of software that automatically organizes a user's file directory. The program identifies similar files, groups them together in new approipately named folders, deletes dulipicates files, and standardizes file names. It will clean up your directories instantly, saving you time and keeping your file explorer looking good.  
  
*How to use it*  
To install the file, download it from our website. Then run the executable named "Directory Organizer." This will bring up an interface. Input the address of the file directory you want to clean. Then custimize your sorting and naming settings. Hit run when you are ready and let the program do the rest. If you are happy with the changes click accept once the program finishes. If not, click cancel which will revert any changes. Put in another file directory if you want or close the program.  

*How to contribute*  
Since our program is under the GNU General Public License, we welcome fellow developers to contribute and help build upon our program. To fork our code, simply make a copy of the source code and open it up with your desired IDE running Python 3.10. Submit any potential changes to the Directory Organizer repositiory. Make sure your pull request includes a detailed list of any potential changes. We will check and approve requests as frequently as possible. Thank you for any potential help with our project!
